## Features

- ⚙️ **Made in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)**
    - We believe Rust is perfect for performance critical applications and efficient memory management.
- 🛠️ **Cross-platform**
    - As a desktop-focused UI framework, nptk is compatible with Windows, Linux, macOS and other Unix-like operating systems.
- 🎨 **Customizable**
    - nptk provides a variety of widgets and themes to customize the look and feel of your application with ease.
- 🚀 **Lightning Fast**
    - Your application will start up fast and run even faster.
    - The UI uses [vello](https://github.com/linebender/vello) for GPU-accelerated rendering and top performance.
- 📦 **Modular**
    - Every crate and feature is optional, so you can only enable what you really need and avoid unnecessary
      dependencies or features.
    - Build widgets using components or using raw vector graphics.
