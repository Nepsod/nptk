# Git Commit Message Rule

## Requirement
When completing a task that involves code changes, **always** include a summarized git commit message at the end of your summary, wrapped in a code block.

## Format
The commit message should:
- Follow conventional commit format (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, etc.)
- Be concise (50-72 characters for the subject line)
- Include a brief description of what was changed
- Optionally include a body with more details if the change is complex

## Example
After completing a refactoring task, end your summary with:

```
refactor(app): extract methods from MayRunner::run()

Break down the long run() method into smaller focused methods for
better readability and maintainability.
```

## When to Include
- After making code changes
- After refactoring
- After fixing bugs
- After adding features
- After updating documentation that affects code
- After any task that modifies files in the repository

## When to Skip
- Pure read-only operations (reading files, searching codebase)
- Conversational responses without code changes
- Questions or clarifications
