# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Maycoon?

Maycoon is a framework for building fast and robust Desktop Applications using beautiful Widgets and easy-to-use app
logic.

It is heavily inspired by [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and can be used to make cross-platform UIs that run fast and
reliable on the GPU using [Femto Vector Graphics](https://github.com/femtovg/femtovg).

## Why 'Maycoon'?
The name 'Maycoon' is derived from the [Maine Coon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_Coon) cat breed, and we coincidentally adopted 'Maycoon' as a fancy name for this project.

## What Platforms does Maycoon support?

Maycoon currently only supports Desktop platforms like macOS, Linux and Windows.

We currently have no plans to support Android, iOS or Web, but hopefully we will eventually do that.
