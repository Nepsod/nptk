Maycoon is a framework for building fast and robust Desktop Applications using beautiful Widgets and easy-to-use app
logic.

It is heavily inspired by [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and can be used to make cross-platform UIs that run fast and
reliable on the GPU using [Femto Vector Graphics](https://github.com/femtovg/femtovg).
